    Describe the data structure(s) you will use as input for your program.

I used if/else/elseif statements to see if the key was play, release, or wait. Then I printed out a string of the corresponding command. After that, I used the notes[obj][key] to print out the note that is being played.


    Include at least two test song files with your code on GitHub. Explain here why they're good test cases and how they      exercise all parts of your code.

I believe these are good examples as they use the play, wait, and release functions. They also use decimal places for the wait times. These examples also play chords as well as single notes.
